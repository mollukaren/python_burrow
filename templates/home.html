      <p>This tiny Lob replica is my sample project for the SalesLoft Junior Engineering Role.</p>

    <p>This is my second time presenting this webapp, so I'm very interested in feedback regarding best practices in code construction, user experience, and file structure.  </p>
    <p>Since this is a small Lob wrapper (and Lob's mascot is Larry the Lobster), I thought it fitting to keep an unintrusive crawfish motif throughout the webapp. I hope you enjoy the site.</p>
